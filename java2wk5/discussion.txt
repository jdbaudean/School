To create a button labeled OK you would need to create a new JButton object with the first parameter being the text "OK" in quotes.

To change the text on a button you would just change the text in the first parameter from "OK" to whatever you wanted it to say.

To set an icon you first need to create an ImageIcon object, the relative or absolute path being the first parameter.  The default icon should be
specified in the second parameter when you initially create the JButton object.  You will need to create an ImageIcon object for 
each different icon that you plan to use.  To change the icon on rollover, you would need to use the setRolloverIcon method for the JButton object.
To change the icon when pressed you would need to use the setPressedIcon method for the JButton object.
